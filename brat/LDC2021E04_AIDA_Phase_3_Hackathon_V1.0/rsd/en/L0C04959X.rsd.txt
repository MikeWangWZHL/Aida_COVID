Norway Scientist Claims Report Proves Coronavirus Was Lab-Made


Norwegian scientist Birger Sørensen has claimed the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is not natural in origin.
The claims by the co-author of the British-Norwegian study—published in the Quarterly Review of Biophysics—are supported by the former head of Britain’s MI6, Sir Richard Dearlove.

The study from Sørensen and British professor Angus Dalgleish show that the coronavirus's spike protein contains sequences that appear to be artificially inserted.

They also highlight the lack of mutation since its discovery, which suggests it was already fully adapted to humans.
The study goes on to explain the rationale for the development of Biovacc-19, a candidate vaccine for COVID-19 that is now in advanced pre-clinical development.

Forbes now lists the page as "no longer active".
Of course that's just dandy since it will fuel conspiracy theories about Western media being complicit in a cover-up with the ChiComs.
If the paper lacks merit, normal science will eventually show that.
But whether it's right or wrong, pulling down article about it is sure to convince a lot of people something nefarious is going on.

It comes up for me.

It comes up, promptly fades and is replaced with "This page is no longer active".
I wanted to see the original study.

@Smokin Joe they apparently have it behind a paywall after some number of Forbes views.
The same thing happened to me with Chrome just now (which worked before) but if I use my Microsoft Edge browser it pops up like it did in Chrome earlier.
Any different browser that doesn't have Forbes cookies will probably work short term to read the story.
It isn't long.


Thanks, @DB https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/DBBC0FA6E3763B0067CAAD8F3363E527/S2633289220000083a.pdf/biovacc19_a_candidate_vaccine_for_covid19_sarscov2_developed_from_analysis_of_its_general_method_of_action_for_infectivity.pdf is a link to the PDF of the study for anyone interested.

This is as the Nature paper described, https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3985 ,

Additionally, in vivo experiments demonstrate replication of the chimeric virus in mouse lung with notable pathogenesis.
Evaluation of available SARS-based immune-therapeutic and prophylactic modalities revealed poor efficacy; both monoclonal antibody and vaccine approaches failed to neutralize and protect from infection with CoVs using the novel spike protein.


What I find highly disturbing is that Dr Fauci used taxpayer dollars to fund this lab.
What were their goals exactly, and why are we doing anything of this nature with scientists in China?
I find that highly troubling and worthy of a full investigation, but I see nothing but crickets on the subject.

Proven man made and started in China?
Claims would be in the $Trillions.
Think the Chicoms are going to allow that?


An anti-covid 19 book was mentioned on tv one night last week, the title was on and off the screen so fast I didn't get it written down.
Allegedly, it lists the attempts to scam people over the alleged effects of a virus which has a much less serious effect than we are being led to believe.
Names names like Fauci, Birx, and others.
Amazon is refusing to carry it.
Does anyone know anything at all about this book?
I have had many doubts about the alleged truths being touted as gospel in this so-called pandemic.
Are we being led or what?
How long will the face mask attire last?
Seems like a lot of hogwash, bull crap stuff.
Sad that so much fear is being put out there.

Now, off the soapbox for me.
Know anything about such a book?

No doubt the effects of the disease were overstated, and we as a society over reacted.
But to call the whole thing hogwash and scam?
Tell that to family who lives a 1/4 mile down the road from me who had a family member die of the thing.
And yes, I knew the guy.

Bottom line.... protect and take precautions with those at risk.
Otherwise, let the country get back to normal

How many have read Sun Tsu's

Art of War

?
The Chinese will simply ignore any lawsuits.
Just as they have proceeded to build out their military hegemony in the Pacific for the purpose of seizing resources that are claimed by several other countries in the region.
They have been practicing Asymmetrical Warfare against the US and other countries for years.

10-20 years ago maybe.
These guys are now too invested in the joys of capitalism and a world economy.
They'll squish it through covert ways way before any world claims court or tribunal is establshed.
