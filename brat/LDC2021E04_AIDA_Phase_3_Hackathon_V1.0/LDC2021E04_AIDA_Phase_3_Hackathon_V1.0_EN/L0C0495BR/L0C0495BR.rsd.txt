CIA targeted in virus disinformation campaign



Four months after the outbreak of the coronavirus disease in China, investigators are still no closer to determining the origin of what has now produced a global pandemic.

Dr. Liang Wannian, head of a panel of experts on the virus with the China National Health Commission, recently called the virus "cunning" for its unusual characteristics and told reporters in China last week the origin remains a mystery.

But Chinese state-run media outlets are increasingly been promoting a new disinformation theory that the virus originated in the U.S., reports that have prompted rumors spreading throughout China and Asia that the CIA was behind the outbreak.

The agency vehemently denies the charge.

"The CIA does not comment on such outlandish and offensive misinformation," said CIA Press Secretary Timothy L. Barrett.

Theories of the virus origin range from a natural jump from animal to humans to a medical research study gone band to a secret biological warfare agent.
Former Israeli military intelligence officer and medical doctor Dany Shoham, who has studied Chinese biological warfare, said China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology, located in the city that is the epicenter of the outbreak, has been linked to Beijing’s covert bio-weapons program.

The Chinese government and major Western publications have dismissed theories that the virus could be linked to the Wuhan center, while some analysts say Beijing is eager to promote stories shifting the blame.
