Hand santizer do: Rub your hands until they're dry
When using a hand sanitizer, don't just let your hands air dry.
For the sanitizer to be most effective, rub your hands together until they're dry, Tuznik said.
Hand sanitizers should be at least 60% alcohol.
The most commonly used safe version is ethanol, also known as ethyl alcohol.
Don't use a sanitizer with methanol.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned that methanol is toxic and can be absorbed through the skin.
It also warned that more than 100 sanitizers have been mislabeled as ethanol.
You can find the list of hand sanitzers to avoid on the FDA's website.
