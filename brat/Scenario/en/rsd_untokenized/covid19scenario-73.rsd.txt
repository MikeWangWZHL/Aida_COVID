Disproof

The statement has no supporting evidence and is another example of conspiracy narratives on a plot against China, profitable to the US; on the UK which invented coronavirus.

The current coronavirus (2019-nCoV) comes from a family of viruses that include other viruses such as SARS and MERS.
It was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan in central China and has been rapidly spreading with new cases being reported in the Asia-Pacific region as well as Europe, North America and the Middle East, causing more than 700 deaths by 10 February 2020.
The identity of the animal source of the coronavirus, named nCoV-2019, has been one of the key questions for the researchers.
Coronaviruses are known to circulate in mammals and birds, and scientists have already suggested that nCoV-2019 originally came from bats.
One of the previous coronaviruses that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, spread from bats to civet cats to humans.
Now, the South China Agricultural University in Guangzhou says that two of its researchers have identified the pangolin as the potential source of nCoV-2019.
This was announced to reporters at a press conference on 7 February 2020.
As for the statement that British scientists from Porton Down laboratory put poison on the Skripals' door handle, it is not supported by any evidence.
British police and intelligence investigations have produced hard forensic evidence which was sufficient to charge two Russian nationals, identified as officers of the Russian Military Intelligence, GRU, for the attack on the Skripals.
Part of the material has been released to the public.
See previous pro-Kremlin disinformation cases, alleging that cancer, syphilis and Spanish flu are US biological weapons and that the Rockefeller foundation owns the patent for Zika virus.
