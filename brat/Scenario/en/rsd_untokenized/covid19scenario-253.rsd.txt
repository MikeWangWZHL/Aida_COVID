Cold weather gear

Wear your scarf, ski mask or balaclava over your mask Scarves, ski masks and balaclavas are not substitutes for masks

People with beards

Certain types of facial hair, like beards, can make mask fitting difficult.
Masks that fit well protect you better.
To have a better fit, people with beards can shave their beards or trim their beards close to the face.
Other ways to improve fit

Use a mask fitter or brace.
Wear one disposable mask underneath a cloth mask that has multiple layers of fabric.
The second mask should push the edges of the inner mask against the face and beard.
For people with beards that are not trimmed close to the face, masks may fit loosely around the beard.
However, people with beards should still wear a mask.
Masks designed for people with beards are being evaluated, and information will be provided when it becomes available.
For more information on evidence for effectiveness of masks, other types of face protection, and mask alternatives, see Guidance for Wearing Masks
