Delta State Government has dismissed claims by some traditional medicine practitioners in the state that they could cure Ebola Virus Disease.In a press release issued by the Commissioner for Information, Mr. Chike Ogeah, on Thursday, the state government said, “The claims are completely false, untenable, dangerous and represent a threat to public health.“It is hereby restated that there is no known cure yet for the Ebola Virus Disease.
The media, especially television and radio broadcast houses should refrain from promoting any claim of cure for EVD by any unorthodox medical practitioner.“Any jingle and promotional programme claiming to have the cure for EVD should no longer be broadcast.”The commissioner warned traditional medical practitioners and spiritual healers to desist from making any claim of cure for EVD.“Anybody that makes sure claims again will be considered a threat to public health and arrested by the relevant security agencies,” he said.He reiterated the instruction of the World Health Organisation and health agencies in Nigeria that observance of strict hygiene and health rules to stave off contact with the disease remain the best option.“Experts have also advised that regular washing of hands with soap, avoiding contact with infected persons and avoiding eating bush meat not sufficiently cooked will protect everybody from being infected with the disease,” he added.The Governor of Delta State, Dr. Emmanuel Uduaghan, had constituted an inter-ministerial Ebola Virus Outbreak Preparedness and Response Committee to superintendent efforts at preventing an outbreak of EVD in Delta State.While assuring that there was no outbreak of EVD in the state, Ogeah called on residents to remain vigilant and observe basic rules of cleanliness.
