The coronavirus is heading the news these days, and of course – all fakes around it.
The primary object is to cause panic.
One can hear “exclusive stories”, such as: “according to the Ministry of Health, more than 112 persons have died in Siberia and the Far East“.
More than 200 similar reports have been detected by the Fund for Defending National Values.
One can hear such delusional stories as “FBI reports that more than 100.000 persons have died in China and almost 3 millions are infected.” Why would the FBI care?
This organisation deals only with internal issues of the USA.
Why not the NSA or CIA?
And those US specialists from “China” do not act delicately: “Tens of thousands are dead and thousands corps are burned at waste stations“.
Behind this stand the giant pharmaceutical companies, attempting to forward their business interests.
