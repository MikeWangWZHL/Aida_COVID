There is a tremendous amount of disinformation circulating regarding the use of masks to decrease transmission of COVID-19.
As with many aspects of the pandemic, mask use has become politicized which is unfortunate when it comes to public health.
All science, including public health science, is messy.
Recommendations change as evidence becomes available.
A new virus with limited data, such as the coronavirus causing COVID-19, adds to the uncertainty.
Initially there was a significant shortage of masks for frontline workers, which was why authorities were reluctant to recommend mask wearing to the general public.
It is understandable that people may look back at this old advice and not know what to believe.
I think we should trust the public health scientists and realize their recommendations may change as better data becomes available.
It took years to fully understand transmission of HIV.
People who disregarded emerging recommendations for safe practices in the early days of HIV did not fare as well as those who took precautions to protect themselves and their loved ones.
What We Do Know
The coronavirus is primarily transmitted person to person via respiratory spray.
Staying away from people (social distancing) and decreasing the germs being transmitted between people are both ways to decrease the spread of the virus.
While high quality research regarding mask use is limited, all of the data supports mask wearing as a key public health measure to decrease viral spread.
