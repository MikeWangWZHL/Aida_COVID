The cases the report referred to are listed in this very database, documenting the most common disinformation narratives and examples in many different languages by pro-Kremlin media: more than two hundred are on the coronavirus.
The EEAS did not publish a report accusing Russia of spreading disinformation on March 16th.
However, some parts of an internal report were leaked to news agencies and were subsequently commented on by the Kremlin.
The report itself included several examples of disinformation.
