Despite evidence to the contrary, nearly 3 in 10 Americans believe the coronavirus was created in a lab, according to survey results released Wednesday by the Pew Research Center.
Approximately 29% of those surveyed said the virus was "most likely" made in a lab, with a large share of that group (23%) saying it was done so intentionally.
Only 6% of respondents said the coronavirus was created accidentally, while 43% said it most likely came about naturally.
Another quarter of respondents noted they were unsure.
At least one study from March from the Scripps Research Institute found that the novel coronavirus is a product of natural evolution, with there being no evidence that it was created in a lab or otherwise engineered.
Globally, there are more than 1.4 million cases of and 83,000 deaths caused by COVID-19, according to the latest data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.
Pew's survey results contain differences between certain demographics.
Younger adults and those with a high school diploma or a lower education level were more likely to believe that the coronavirus was made in a lab.
Republicans were also more likely than Democrats to say the coronavirus was created by scientists.
The survey also touched on news consumption during the pandemic.
Nearly half of respondents (approximately 47%) said they had come across at least some news stories or information that "seemed completely made up."
Of that group, 12% said they had seen "a lot" of examples of misinformation.
The Pew survey was conducted March 10-16 and gathered information from 8,914 U.S. adults, with a margin of error of 1.6%.
