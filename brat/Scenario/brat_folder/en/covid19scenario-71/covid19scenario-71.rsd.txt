Edit : Since apparently some people think I'm trying to get medical advice from swimmers, just wanted to reiterate that I'm not.
This is something all of us will need to consider when getting into the pool again so I wanted to know what you think - those of you willing to help me out here.
I couldn't find any articles online about swimming pools and the virus.
They just discovered the first case in my country.
She's been travelling all over the country before she showed symptoms apparently.
Does anyone know if it can be transmitted from the person next to me when I'm swimming?
We can't wear masks in the pool so does anyone know what precautions should we take?
In your opinion should people stay out of the pool completely?
What do you plan on doing?
