Disproof
An unfounded claim, presented without sources or evidence.
This is one of many pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about the coronavirus.
COVID-19 is not a biological weapon and there is no proof that it would have been artificially created.
This coronavirus comes from a family of viruses originating in animals that include other viruses such as SARS and MERS.
It was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan in central China and has been rapidly spreading across the world, with cases being reported in 150 countries, territories and areas by 16th of March 2020.
Many other claims have been pushed by pro-Kremlin media since the outbreak started in January, for example, that governments overestimate the threat, that it was born in a laboratory to infect Chinese, that it is an element of hybrid warfare and that the remedy has been developed in Ukraine.
