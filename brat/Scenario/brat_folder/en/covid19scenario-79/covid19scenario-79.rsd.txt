Disproof
The claim about the superiority of political authoritarianism and isolationist “closed societies” in preventing and controlling epidemics does not reflect reality.
Authoritarian regimes, which tend to control and manipulate information and to limit the freedom of doctors and scientists to engage in international cooperation, are often an obstacle to the timely detection and containment of epidemic outbreaks.
A clear example isChina’s deliberate cover-up of the early days of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan.
The regime suppressed information about the virus and allowed it to spread unchecked in the crucial early days and weeks.
The Chinese authorities censored and detained those doctors and whistleblowers who attempted to sound the alarm and warn their fellow citizens when they understood the gravity of the coronavirus threat.
