There's no evidence that taking vitamin C regularly can help prevent coronavirus or COVID-19.
In fact, there's a lot of research looking at vitamin C to help prevent the common cold and it has shown to not be effective.
There is a small study looking at high doses of vitamin C either by mouth of IV (intravenous).
In that study, high-dose vitamin C appeared to decrease the time on a ventilator for seriously ill people with COVID-19.
More research is underway to better understand how we might use IV vitamin C to help treat COVID-19.
